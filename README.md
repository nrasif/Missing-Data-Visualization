# Missing Data Visualization
## What is this?
This is the code that I write systematically in Python notebook in order to get visualization of missing data. There are 2 different dataset that we use in this case. Here are the following dataset and where I get them :
- [Data science salaries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/data-science-jobs-salaries)
- [Volve petroleum production](https://www.equinor.com/energy/volve-data-sharing)

## What libraries do we use?
In this particular case, we utilize several libraries, which are :
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Missingno
- Pandas Profiling

## Where can I get detailed information about 5W+1H quetions on missing values?
I also put the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@naharirasif/imputing-missing-well-log-data-values-with-simple-statistics-and-knn-imputer-58c7343d3163) for a better explanation on why we need to visualize missing data and how it affects our data analysis.
